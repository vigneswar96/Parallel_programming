This is an implementation of a Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method for solving the Poisson equation on a 2D grid. The Poisson equation is a partial differential equation that describes the relationship between a function and its second-order partial derivatives. It has a wide range of applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics.
The Jacobi method, named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, is an iterative algorithm to solve a
system of linear equations. This technique has many applications in numerical computing. For
example, it can be used to solve the following differential equation in two variables x and y:

The Poisson equation is given by:

$$\nabla^2 u = f$$
