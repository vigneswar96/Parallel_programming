This is an implementation of a Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel method for solving the Poisson equation on a 2D grid. The Poisson equation is a partial differential equation that describes the relationship between a function and its second-order partial derivatives. It has a wide range of applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics.
